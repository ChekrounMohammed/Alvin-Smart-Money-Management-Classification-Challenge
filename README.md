# Alvin-Smart-Money-Management-Classification-Challenge
Alvin is a smart money manager app that uses automated budgeting, personalised offers, and applied behavioural game design strategies to help people align their daily spending around their savings goals in a sustainable way.  The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning algorithm that classifies purchases into 13 different categories. Alvin registers most transactions from MPESA notifications, but some users classify their purchases manually.  This solution will help Alvin automatically classify expenditure into different categories, improving Alvinâ€™s services and offerings to their users.
in this challenge i tried to work on a new type of challenge for the first time because the size of the labeled train set is so small ,and the extra train files are not labeled therefore there is a lot of work that can be done on the train set
